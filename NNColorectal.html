										<h1>Neuronal Network to predict Colorectal Histology</h1>
									</header>
									<center><img src="images/colorectalhistology.png" alt="" height="400" width="auto"/></center>
									<p>These images correspond to examples of the dataset with their corresponding label. As you may see their is a label "Tumor", indeed our prediction model could permit to detect cancer. The experimental methodology is incremental: starting from the simplest Neuronal Network, I am trying to improve it by adding layers. </p>
									<p>We have to split the train dataframe and the validation dataframe to develop a model
									using train and prevent overfiting using validation. I arbitrary chose a split of 80%.
									Then I decided to resize the images format as 50x50x3 to improve the compilation time. I also set the batch size at 16
									arbitrary.</p>

										<div style="float: right; margin-right:10px;">
											<img src="images/NNfirstmodel.png" alt="" height="180" style="padding-left: 30px;" />
										</div>
										<p>This is my first model, composed of a Flatten Layer to reshape the dataset elements in one dimension (50x50x3=7500), and
										two Dense layers. The first one with a ReLu activation which is the simplest activation function and I arbitrary chose
										to set the units at 128. The second one got a softmax activation to return a probability vector, and the units parameter is set to 8 as our classification is concerning 8 different labels.</p>
									</div>
									
									<div style="height:350px">
										<div style="float: left; margin-left:10px;">
											<img src="images/NNfirstmodelgraph.png" alt="" height="250" style="padding-right: 30px;" />
										</div>
										<p> <br/>I chose to set the epochs number at 10 to get running time relatively short. We can observe on these graphs that the
										accuracy is about 70% and we got a lot of overfitting because the validation curve is quite different from the train one.</p>	
									</div>
									<div style="height:250px">
										<div style="float: right; margin-right:20px">
											<img src="images/NNsecondmodel.png" alt="" height="200" style="padding-left: 30px;" />
										</div>
										<p><br />I decided to improve our previous model by adding four Convolution 2D layers with ReLu activation and chose arbitrary
										their parameters. In fact, the Convolution2D layers create a convolution kernel that is convolved
										with the layer input to produce a tensor of outputs.</p>
									</div>
									<div style="height:350px">
										<div style="float: left; margin-left:10px;">
											<img src="images/NNsecondmodelgraph.png" alt="" height="250" style="padding-right: 30px;" />
										</div>
										<p> <br />We notice that the accuracy is much better and that this model overfits less
										than the previous one. I am now looking to reduce the overfitting as much as
										possible and increase the accuracy of the model again.</p>
									</div>
		
									<div style="height:250px">
										<div style="float: right; margin-right:20px">
											<img src="images/NNthirdmodel.png" alt="" height="200" style="padding-left: 30px;" />
										</div>
										<p>In this third model I chose to add a Batch Normalization layer because I learnt that this layer type can significantly
										improve the prediction by normalizing the individuals features. I also add a Dropout layer because it permits to prevent
										overfitting by randomly drop neurons.</p>
									</div>
									<div style="height:350px">
										<div style="float: left; margin-left:10px;">
											<img src="images/NNthirdmodelgraph.png" alt="" height="250" style="padding-right: 30px;" />
										</div>
										<p><br/><br/> The accuracy is improved but there is still a lot of overfitting as you may see the difference between both of the curves </p>
									</div>
									<div style="height:250px">
										<div style="float: right; margin-right:20px">
											<img src="images/NNfourthmodel.png" alt="" height="200" style="padding-left: 30px;" />
										</div>
										<p>I tried to replace the BatchNormalization layer by a LayerNormalization layer. In fact such as the BatchNormalization layer</p>
									</div>
									<div style="height:300px">
										<div style="float: left; margin-left:10px;">
											<img src="images/NNfourthmodelgraph.png" alt="" height="250" style="padding-right: 30px;" />
										</div>
										<p><br />Now our model got an accuracy above 90% and a loss very low. The model is still a little bit overfitting but it is
										sufficient to be usable. The accuracy could be improve by upgrading the number of epochs for example.</p>
