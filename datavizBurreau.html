										<h1>Business Intelligence Project for the Barreau de Paris</h1>
									</header>
									<p>The goal of this project is to create a Business Intelligence tool for the deontology department of the lawyers order of Paris : Le Barreau de Paris.<br/>
									This project is a tender made by the Barreau de Paris, indeed the goal is to convey an add of our technical capacity and not really a final and complete tool. <br/>
									We had to query the initial database to create views that could be useable for creating interesting data. But this part is confidential and I can not publish it. So the explanation will only focus on the final product realized with Power BI.
									</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Capture-BIblue.PNG" alt="" style="height: 300px; width:600px; margin: 0 auto"/></span>
									<p>
										Because we built data from existing deficient data, our stakes are not obviously the most effective. <br/> 
										The wish of the Barreau de Paris is to be able to compare the rate of complaints according to lawyers.
										Indeed we created a main page where you can find different repartition for a specific year chose by the user.
									</p>
									<div style="height:250px">
										<div style="float: right; margin-right:10px;">
											<img src="images/Capture-Barreaugraph.PNG" alt="" height="200" style="padding-left: 30px; margin-right: 100px;" />
										</div>
										<p style="margin-left:100px"><br /><br/>We wanted to extend our work by proposing a data extraction : by selecting a data (1) and clicking on "Exploiter les donn√©es" (2), a new page is displayed with filtered data.</p>
									</div>
									<div>
										<center>
										<p style="font-family: Source Sans Pro"><b>We obtain the following page :</b></p>

											style="height: 320px; width:600px; margin: 0 auto" /></span>
									<p>
										On it the selected folder code is mentioned and the user is able to change the trimester period.
										The graphs show us that the lawyers repartition is not the same between the lawyers with complaints and the total population of lawyers.
										Indeed, we can see on the left that the more aged the lawyers are, the more they have complaints against them concerning the first trimester of 2021.
									</p>
									<div style="height:250px">
										<div style="float: right; margin-right:10px;">
											<img src="images/Capture-Burreaucomp.PNG" alt="" height="150"
												style="padding-left: 30px; margin-right: 100px;" />
										</div>
										<p style="margin-left:50px"><br />By passing on these two graphs, the detail is displayed. As for the left graph there is a repartition difference. </p>
									</div>
									<p>You have seen the main tool that we delivered to the Barreau de Paris. We tried to create a dynamic Business Intelligence tool with the few data that we had. We would have been glad to be able to extract the lawyers ID to make a ranking according the amount of complaint by individual, but we could not. <br/>Finally, we win the tender call but my internship finished before the beginning of the real project.</p>
