										<h1>Titanic Prediction</h1>
									</header>
									<p>In this challenge, we have to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were
										more
										likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc)<br />
										We are using Python libraries : Pandas, NumPy, Sklearn, and apply Linear Regression and Random Forest.
									</p>

									</center>
									<p>
										Overview of the data:
										<br/>
										- PassengerId is the unique id of the row and it doesn't have any effect on target
										<br />
										- Survived is the target variable we are trying to predict (0 or 1):
											- 1 = Survived
											- 0 = Not Survived
										<br />
											- Pclass (Passenger Class) is the socio-economic status of the passenger and it is a categorical ordinal feature which
										has 3 unique values (1, 2 or 3):
											 1 = Upper Class,
											 2 = Middle Class,
											 3 = Lower Class.
										<br />
										- Name, Sex and Age are self-explanatory
										<br />
										- SibSp is the total number of the passengers' siblings and spouse
										<br />
										- Parch is the total number of the passengers' parents and children
										<br />
										- Ticket is the ticket number of the passenger
										<br />
										- Fare is the passenger fare
										<br />
										- Cabin is the cabin number of the passenger
										<br />
										- Embarked is port of embarkation and it is a categorical feature which has 3 unique values (C, Q or S)
										: C = Cherbourg,
											Q = Queenstown,
											S = Southampton.

										<p> </br> <br/> We can see that there is a lot more victims from the 3rd class.
										(This graph is not well formatted : The class (1,2 or 3) needs to be taken as a categorical variable, not as a numerical
										one.)</p>

										<p> We plotted the features weights in case of Logistic Regression.
										<br/>Interpretation of weights in Linear Models :
										
										<br/>
										- A positive weight increases the probability of target = 1 (survived)
										<br/>
										- A negative weight decreases the probability of surviving.
										<br/>
										- When a weight is close to zero, it means that the correspond feature doesn't influence the prediction.
										<br/>
										Conclusion for our model: 
										<br/>
										Pclass_1 and Pclass_3 seem very important in our model in comparison to Pclass_2. It shows also that Fare is not
										important for our prediction using a linear model.

											<b>Let's continue with other variables...</b>
										</p>
										<img src="images/Capture-relativedistribAge.PNG" alt="" height="300"/>
										<p>It seems that the age has an impact on the surviving chance.</p>

										</div>
										<p style="margin-left:80px;"><br />By applying the same strategy on age and sex a problem appeared : the age weight is null, whereas by plotting a simple histogram of the surviving chance by age it seems to have an impact.
										<br/> What we just did with the new feature is_child is add non-linearity that a linear model like Logistic Regression can't
										capture without our help.

											<p>
												By using Random Forest we obtain the real weight of the age on the surviving chance.

									</div>
									<p>
										By ploting histplots on Fare and Embarked feature for the survival chances we see that it seems to have an impact on
										it.
										Firstly, we compute a Logistic Regression :
										With this logistic regression we can see that the embarked gate has an impact on the survival chance.
										Then, contrary to what we have seen at the beginning of the lab (1st features importance plot), it seems that the
										Fare
										as an impact on the survival chance : the higher prices have higher chance to survive. But the cheap fares is also
										positive wich is strange.
										So we decided to compute a Random Forest :
										This Random Forest finally tells us that the most impacting feature is the fare price.
