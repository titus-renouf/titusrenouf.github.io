										<h1>Magic : Mobile App</h1>
									</header>
									<p>Magiq is a website developed by Bluescale allowing the company to list the different
									projects carried out by its consultants. It allows the follow-up of the company's time, that is to say the follow-up
									of the exercise of each of the consultants since they are required to work on several projects
									in parallel. Indeed, the employee can connect to his personal space in order to specify the days when
									he worked on such a project. The usefulness of this site is great for consulting companies because it allows
									monitor the activity of its consultants and therefore optimize their offer to their clients.</p>
									<center>
										<img src="images/Magiq1.png" alt="" style="height:300px; margin-right:30px"/>	
										<p style="margin-bottom:50px">The goal of this project is to make the monitoring simpler by using the phone.</p>
									</center>	
									
									<p style="margin-top:80px">
										<b style="margin-left:20px">The API connecting :</b><br/>
											The Magiq mobile application has a particularity: it is the extension of the website of the same name. Thereby,
											the main difficulty of this project is to link the application with the website, and this is
											possible through API requests. An API (Application Programming Interface) is an interface
											allowing software to offer its services to other software.
									</p>
									<p>
										However, it is difficult to ensure the validity of our query functions. An additional tool
										was therefore used to ensure the proper functioning of API requests, it is Postman, a
										software to simulate them.
										Below is a demonstration of the use of the Postman software: we are trying to access the sheets
										time of Bernard Giraud.
									</p>
									<center>
										<img src="images/MagiqPostman.png" alt="" style="height:300px; margin-right:30px" />
										<p style="margin-bottom:50px">To retrieve Bernard Giraud's timesheets, you must first enter the URL
										corresponding to the page listing the time sheets on the website. We use the GET method
										 because we want to retrieve information from this page. In the URL, the mention "current user" tells us that access
										to the information is protected, so you must enter the token retrieved
										previously as a “Bearer Token”. If the token is not filled in, the software will return
										a blank page indicating that the URL is valid, but will display the message "401 Unauthorized"
										prohibiting access to data. If all the conditions are met, by clicking on "Send" the
										software will return the requested object: the list of timesheet details.
										Thanks to the recovery of these details and the corresponding names, we will be able to reuse them
										in our app.</p>
									</center>
									<center>
										<img src="images/Capture-webdevAPI.PNG" alt="" style="height:300px;" />
										<p style="margin-bottom:50px">By having simulated the request thanks to the Postman software, we are then able to set it up in
										the code of the mobile application. The "username" and "password" parameters will correspond to the
										body which will be sent in the authentication page of the site thanks to the POST method and through
										the URL. Thanks to this function, the user will be able to connect to his user space on the application.
										API calls having an essential place for the development of the application, we will use the
										Postman software throughout the development period.</p>
									</center>
									<p style="margin-top:80px">
										<b style="margin-left:20px">The App Simulation :</b><br />
										It is important to note that the following presentation corresponds to the beta version of
										the app. Indeed, it is not fully completed and has not followed its verification tests
										final, nevertheless we find the main functionalities.
									</p>
									<center>
										<img src="images/Magiq2.png" alt="" style="height:300px; margin-right:30px" />
										<p style="margin-bottom:50px">The left page corresponds to the home page of the application, it allows you to enter the name of
										the company to which the employee belongs in place of the shaded word "organisation". By then pressing
										on the “Validé” button, the connection page is displayed (right page). The company logo
										appears above the authentication fields. The Cogirep logo on the image corresponds to a
										fictitious company used so as not to disrupt the integrity of Bluescale's Magiq account.
										It is possible to retrieve your password if you forget it by clicking on the "Mot de passe oublié" button.</p>
									</center>
									<center>
										<img src="images/Magiq3.png" alt="" style="height:300px; " />
										<p style="margin-bottom:50px">Once the authentication is successful, the user finds himself on the left page named "Mes Feuilles de Temps". We
										finds the same functionalities: the month and the year, the number of days selected, the
										percentage of days selected compared to the number of days available and finally the status of the
										timesheet.
										Two other pages are also accessible through the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen.
										The central page corresponds to the days off to come and past. In this case, a leave of one
										half-day dated November 17, 2021 has been accepted by the company's administration.
										The application is able to store this leave authorization as an upcoming or past event.
										Finally, the right page allows the user, in this case Bernard Giraud, to disconnect from
										the app.</p>
									</center>
									<center>
										<img src="images/Magiq4.png" alt="" style="height:300px; " />
										<p style="margin-bottom:50px">By pressing on a month in the list on the “Mes Feuilles de Temps” page, the user finds himself on
										this page called for this beta version "Timesheet". It corresponds to the second page of the
										model of part 3.1.1. Note that on the left page the sheet is blank, it has been
										then filled in as shown on page 2: by selecting the “0”, “0.5 or “1” buttons.
										By clicking on the “Sauvegarder” button, the application takes into account the
										changes in the timesheet. Returning to the “Mes Feuilles de Temps” page, we notice
										that the element October 2021 has updated: there are now 5.5 working days selected, which
										correspond to 26% of the available days, the status of the timesheet is still "Brouillon".</p>
									</center>
									<center>
										<img src="images/Magiq5.png" alt="" style="height:300px;" />
										<p style="margin-bottom:50px">Returning to our October 2021 timesheet, the left page is displayed as it was
										modified. By clicking on the “Nom Projet: …” box, a pop-up window appears. It displays the list
										current projects to which the user is assigned. By selecting the other project, “Assistance
										VAR”, the pop-up window disappears and gives way to the updated timesheet. The name of the project is
										became the selected one and the amount of work per day counters were reset to zero.
										Nevertheless the pellets kept their shape, but still changed color to indicate
										that these days have been selected for another project, in this case it is the project
										Development of a bubble management application. It is now possible to fill in the
										empty spaces for the "Assistance VAR" project.</p>
									</center>
									<center>
										<img src="images/Magiq6.png" alt="" style="height:300px;" />
										<p style="margin-bottom:50px">After selecting other working days for the "Assistance VAR" project, we test another
										feature: unlocking days off. By clicking on the “…” icon, a new pop-up window appears with the mention “Déverrouiller”. By
										clicking on it on off days (weekends, public holidays
										and holidays) that were grayed out are no longer grayed out. It is now possible to select them as
										working day. By clicking again on the “…” icon, you can now select the button
										“Verrouiller ” which will now lock off days.
										By saving our timesheet and returning to the main page, we realize that the
										changes made have been taken into account by the indicators.</p>
									</center>
									<center>
										<img src="images/Magiq7.png" alt="" style="height:300px;" />
										<p style="margin-bottom:50px">Once the user has filled all of his working time for the month of October 2021, he must
										validate their timesheet. To do this, click on the "Validé" button, a new pop-up window appears to ensure that it is
										not a bad manipulation. Indeed, once
										validated the time sheet cannot be modified. If the user validates his choice, the pop-up
										disappears and returning to the main page we notice that the status of the October timesheet
										2021 has been updated to "Validé".</p>
									</center>
									<p>
										This beta version therefore includes the expected functionalities but still lacks fluidity. Moreover, there are some issues to improve. For example the fact that the list of timesheets does not arrive
										completely sorted in chronological order, or even when the user
										would like to check off half a day. Indeed, if there is already an orange half-disc, instead of the
										complete and thus have a two-color circle, the half-pad will simply change color.
										Nevertheless the application will still understand that in this day there is a half-day of
										work assigned to one project and the other half to another project, this is only a display issue. We
										should also replace the title of the “Timesheet” page with the title of the timesheet,
										“Octobre 2021” for example.
